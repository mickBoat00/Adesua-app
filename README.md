# Why Adesua?
#### What is Adesua
Adesua is a ghanaian language word for education. Adesua is a platform where parents can get access to lessons for their wards based on their current school year and school curriculum.

#### Why Adesua
Growing up as a student in Ghana, we had private after school lessons from teachers who were not necessarily your school teacher at home, but the lessons were based on our school curriculum follows your school's curriculum 

Also it was normal to go for vacation or summer break classes at cousins', friends' or the best schools in our vicinity.
This happens because students sometimes neeeds a different point of view or explanation.

So why not create a platform where you students can get access to courses based on their curriculum from some of the best teachers from prestigious schools in their country

Hence `Adesua` app is the backend for a platform where parents will have access to courses for their wards based on their current curriculum, school year and subject from vetted course instructor 
Course Instructors are currrently good teachers in other school.

Every Course created by a teacher for the platform passes through verfication checks before the the course is published on the platform.
