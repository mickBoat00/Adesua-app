# Why Adesua?
Growing up as a student in Ghana, it was normal to have private after school lessons from teachers who were not necessarily your school teacher at home but follows your school's curriculum 
Also it was normal to go for vacation or summer break classes at other schools.
Hence `Adesua` app is the backend for a platform where parents will have access to courses for their wards based on their current curriculum, school year and subject from vetted course instructor 
Course Instructors are currrently good teachers in other school.

Every Course created by a teacher for the platform passes through verfication checks before the the course is published on the platform.
