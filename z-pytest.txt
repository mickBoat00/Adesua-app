The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, 
and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

Pytest is a python testing tool

pytest-django is a plugin for pytest that provides a set of useful tools for testing Django applications and projects.


Why would I use this instead of Django’s manage.py test command?

Running the test suite with pytest offers some features that are not present in Django’s standard test mechanism:
Less boilerplate: no need to import unittest, create a subclass with methods. Just write tests as regular functions.
Manage test dependencies with fixtures.
Run tests in multiple processes for increased speed.
There are a lot of other nice plugins available for pytest.
Easy switching: Existing unittest-style tests will still work without any modifications.


FIXTURES
Fixtures are funtions run before/after each test funtion to which it is applied.

Fixture to collect database from a database or to prepare a database connection

Fixture are used to feed data to the tests such database connections, urls to test and input data.

funtion    Run once per test
class      Run once per class of tests
Module     Run once per module
Session    Run once per session


conftest.py this file will be look in by pytest before it runs any test
conftest.py will be used to set up our fixtures


any function or class that create an object is a factory
